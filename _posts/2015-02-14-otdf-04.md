Long time no see! I was busy with my studies (and also unlocking "Real Platinum God" achievement in The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth, as SOMEONE pointed out) but now I have some free time and I decided to spend it on OTDF, here's what I have accomplished during the last few days:

<ul>
	<li>Fixed many bugs with enemies movement</li>
	<li>Polished player movement - now he will always stop exactly in front of the enemy after attack</li>
	<li>Added new types of enemies with multiple lives and attack patterns</li>
	<li>Implemented basic difficulty progression (harder enemies appear after reaching certain score)</li>
</ul>

Below you can see a video presenting those changes:

I've been also trying to implement blood with particle effects, but it look like shit so I'll probably just use animated gifs instead.

I have a hard time deciding what to do next. Everything is very basic, but playable now. I "just" need to: add graphics, music, sound effects, menu, options, achievements, android market integration, some special effects and I am ready to upload on android market. I'll probably focus on graphics now because I can't wait to see animations in action.
