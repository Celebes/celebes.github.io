I've been busy lately working on my newest game named "One Tap Death Finger". It is a simple fighting game where every screen tap (or mouse click) is an attack. Player has to wait for enemies to enter zone around him before attacking. Otherwise he will miss and become vulnerable to enemy attacks.

Below is a raw screenshot from the current version:

</div>

As you can see there's the player in the middle and enemies approaching from both sides. There are two attack zones: left and right. Player has a HP bar with 10 lives. The goal is to kill as many enemies as possible. Every kill gives 1 point, total score is visible at the top.
