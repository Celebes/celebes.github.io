Today I have earned the Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer I (long name, huh?) certificate! My passing score was 88%. 

I am really proud of myself, I studied hard for it every other day for the past 2 months. I read book preparing for the exam by Mala Gupta from cover to cover and it was enough effort to pass. I will do more mock exams for Oracle Certified Professional, though, because I feel like I was fooled couple of times. I will avoid that in the future.
