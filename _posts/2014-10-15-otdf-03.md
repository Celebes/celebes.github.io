In today's update I'd like to introduce weapons. There are 2 types of them in the game: a bow and a stick.
<br/>
<br/>
Bow let's you shoot limited number of arrows that will instantly kill anyone on their way. You can only shoot one arrow at a time, so you can't "spam" them:
<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/assets/movies/otdf/otdf-bow-test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag. Ditch your IE and join the Firefox or Chrome master race!
	</video>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
Stick extends player's attack range by one unit in every direction. It will break after couple of hits:
<br/>

	</video>
</div>

<br/>
In order to acquire weapons you have to kill enemies. Every enemy has a chance of spawning with equipped weapon, which they will drop when killed:

	</video>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
In the next update I will focus on new types of enemies.
