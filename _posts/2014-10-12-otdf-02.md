Little update, I just wanted to show that I implemented something called POWER SMASH. Player has a 20% chance to activate it and when he does it extends his attack range to reach nearby enemies. Watch video below if you don't know what I am talking about.
<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/assets/movies/otdf/otdf-power-smash.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag. Ditch your IE and join the Firefox or Chrome master race!
	</video>
</div>

<br/>
Next I will focus on adding weapons, which extend player's range a little bit until they break and different types of enemies that are harder to beat, meaning they can take more than one hit and can switch sides.
