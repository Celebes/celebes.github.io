Quick update! Instead of watching thriller movies all day I added enemy walking animation and also different colors of enemies. Color depends on enemy's attack pattern. Check it out:

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/assets/movies/otdf/enemy-animation-color.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag. Ditch your IE and join the Firefox or Chrome master race!
	</video>
</div>
