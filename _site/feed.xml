        <title>New game approaching</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been busy lately working on my newest game named “One Tap Death Finger”. It is a simple fighting game where every screen tap (or mouse click) is an attack. Player has to wait for enemies to enter zone around him before attacking. Otherwise he will miss and become vulnerable to enemy attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a raw screenshot from the current version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-02/otdf-prototype-01.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see there’s the player in the middle and enemies approaching from both sides. There are two attack zones: left and right. Player has a HP bar with 10 lives. The goal is to kill as many enemies as possible. Every kill gives 1 point, total score is visible at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oracle Certified Associate unlocked!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I have earned the Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer I (long name, huh?) certificate! My passing score was 88%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really proud of myself, I studied hard for it every other day for the past 2 months. I read book preparing for the exam by Mala Gupta from cover to cover and it was enough effort to pass. I will do more mock exams for Oracle Certified Professional, though, because I feel like I was fooled couple of times. I will avoid that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello, world!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh hi, didn’t see you there, guess what I just did.. this blog/portfolio/thing. It is pretty basic for now, but I am glad the making process is over, because I have other, very serious things to do - study hard for an upcoming java certification exam (Oracle Certified Associate). I will start tomorrow, though..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now you can write comments here, check out my awesome &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;about me&lt;/a&gt; page or even play my first video game ever - &lt;a href=&quot;/games/piglethrower/&quot;&gt;piglethrower&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/games/gorky/&quot;&gt;Gorky’s&lt;/a&gt; page and even more stuff is coming soon so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
