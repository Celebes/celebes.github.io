  <h2>About Piglethrower</h2>
  
  <p>
	<strong>Development time:</strong> 2 weeks
	<br/>
	<strong>Release date:</strong> June 2012
	<br/><br/>
	Piglethrower was my first game ever, I did it as a university project on 2nd year for "JTP" class ("JÄ™zyki i Techniki Programowania", which can be translated to "Programming Languages and Techniques"), where we were learning programming in Java for the first time. I had little to no programming skills, even though I was already familiar with a little bit of C, C++ and OOP. I didn't even know what version control, unit testing, design patterns, software engineering, frameworks etc. were. I am surprised this game even works and of course its code quality sucks, but I still love it. I was relying heavily on "Black Art of Java Game Programming" book back then, which is awesome but a little bit outdated. It taught me how to use interfaces and other good practices, but as my codebase grow it became a total spaghetti.

	Fun fact: at first I was planning to use my photoshopped head instead of a pig and the goal was to eat brains instead of apples. So it was supposed to be zombie-themed. But my professor said it is not allowed and that I had to came up with something more <em>serious</em>. So I came up with a piglet jumping around to epic sax guy! Eat that, professor! Below are sprites used in the very early stage of development:

			</tr>
		</table>

	The rules of the game are simple - grab a pig by pressing a mouse button and throw it by moving the cursor and releasing the button. You have 10 moves, there are 10 apples and only 1 level. There is a small circular area around your character telling you how far you can move. After crossing it, the pig will be released automatically.
	
	<br/><br/>
	
	This game sucks in general - physics are a joke, collision detection is implemented so badly that you can literally move through walls, but it was a big achievement for me at the time and I am still proud of it. I particularly like the character - I have drawn and animated this pig myself and I think it looks good, especially the falling animation (you can even see little tears of fear in the corner of eyes):

  <h2>Play</h2>
  
  <p>
	You may have problems (application and security errors) if you will try to play it here - the game was written as a Java Applet which is something like a Java program running in the browser, but it is not very popular, considered a safety threat and therefore hard to run using a modern browser.
	<br/><br/>
	It is not impossible, just install newest Java and Java Runtime Environment and then follow those steps:
	<br/>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to Control Panel on Windows.</li>
		<li>Select JAVA (you may have to search for it).</li>
		<li>Go to "Security" tab.</li>
		<li>Click "Edit Site List".</li>
		<li>Click "Add".</li>
		<li>Paste URL of this site there (http://celebes.github.io/games/piglethrower/).</li>
		<li>Click "Ok".</li>
		<li>Click "Continue" on security warning.</li>
	</ol>
	
	After all that extra work you should get a new warning (yay!) with 3 choices - select "run" and you should be able to play!
	<br/><br/>
	There are some problems with the music sadly, just find "epic sax guy 10 hours" on youtube and play it in the background for full immersion..
